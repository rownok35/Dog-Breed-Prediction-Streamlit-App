In this project, we will see how to use Keras and TensorFlow to build, train, and test a Convolutional Neural Network capable of identifying the breed of a dog in a supplied image. This is a supervised learning problem, specifically a multiclass classification problem.
The model is built in google colab and we have selected just first 3 breeds (Limitation due to computation power)
